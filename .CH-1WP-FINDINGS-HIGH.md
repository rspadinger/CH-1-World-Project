# M01 - MembershipFactory::joinDAO - tier fees are transferred to the DAO creator, but the DAO creator cannot retrieve those fees

## Summary

**Link:** https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-11-one-world/blob/1e872c7ab393c380010a507398d4b4caca1ae32b/contracts/dao/MembershipFactory.sol#L147

Each time a member joins a DAO, the creator gets some fees:

```
IERC20(daos[daoMembershipAddress].currency).transferFrom(_msgSender(), daoMembershipAddress, tierPrice - platformFees);
```

However, there is no way for the DAO owner to retrieve those fees, because the contract is lacking a withdraw function.


## Vulnerability Details

Some details...

**Proof of Concept:**

Add the following test to MembershipFactory.test.ts in the "Join DAO" describe block:

```
it("DAO creator cannot withdraw fees", async function () {      
  //addr1 joins the DAO at the lowes level (2) and pays the fee
  await testERC20.mint(addr1.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));
  await testERC20.connect(addr1).approve(membershipFactory.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));
  await membershipFactory.connect(addr1).joinDAO(membershipERC1155.address, 2);
 
  //the DAO contains the correct balance: 100 - 20% protocol fee = 80
  expect(await testERC20.balanceOf(membershipERC1155.address)).to.equal(80); 

  //the DAO creator still holds the original balance: 100 - 80 = 20
  expect(await testERC20.balanceOf(owner.address)).to.equal(20);
  
  //only the protocol owner can withdraw the fees for the DAO creator using callExternalContract
  const calldataTransfer = testERC20.interface.encodeFunctionData("transfer", [owner.address, 80]);
  const encodedCalldata = membershipERC1155.interface.encodeFunctionData("callExternalContract", [testERC20.address, calldataTransfer]);
  await membershipFactory.callExternalContract(membershipERC1155.address, encodedCalldata);
  
  //now, the DAO creator received the fees - the new balance is: 20 + 80 = 100
  expect(await testERC20.balanceOf(owner.address)).to.equal(100);
});
```

## Impact

THe DAO creator cannot withdraw accrued fees.


## Tools Used

Manual Review


## Recommendations

Add a withdraw function that allows the DAO creator to withdraw accrued fees.

# M02 - MembershipFactory::upgradeTier - when tokens are burnded/minted, the corresponding TierConfig.minted values are not updated

## Summary

**Link:** https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-11-one-world/blob/1e872c7ab393c380010a507398d4b4caca1ae32b/contracts/dao/MembershipFactory.sol#L155

The upgradeTier function allows to upgrade the tier level if the DAO is of type Sponsored. However, the the lower tier tokens are burned and the higher tier token is minted, the values for TierConfig.minted of the corresponding tier configuration are not updated. Also, for the higher tier, the new TierConfig.minted value needs to be verified and it must not be bigger than TierConfig.amount.


## Vulnerability Details

**Proof of Concept:**

Add the following test to MembershipFactory.test.ts in the "Upgrade Tier" describe block:

```
it("TierConfig.minted is not updated when a Sponsored DAO membership is upgraded", async function () {
  //provide & approve test tokens to user to purchase DAO membership
  await testERC20.mint(addr1.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));
  await testERC20.connect(addr1).approve(membershipFactory.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));

  //user joins the Sponsored DAO at the lowest tier (tier 6) with 2 membership tokens
  await membershipFactory.connect(addr1).joinDAO(membershipERC1155.address, 6);
  await membershipFactory.connect(addr1).joinDAO(membershipERC1155.address, 6);

  //at this stage, tier 6 should contain 2 and tier 5 should contain 0 membership tokens 
  expect((await membershipFactory.tiers(membershipERC1155.address))[6].minted).to.equal(2)
  expect((await membershipFactory.tiers(membershipERC1155.address))[5].minted).to.equal(0)

  //user upgrades from tier 6 to the next higher tier (tier 5)
  await membershipFactory.connect(addr1).upgradeTier(membershipERC1155.address, 6);

  //at this stage, tier 6 should contain 0 (2 tokens burned) and tier 5 should contain 1 membership token (1 token minted)
  //however, tier 6 still contain 2 tokens and tier 5 contains 0 tokens
  expect((await membershipFactory.tiers(membershipERC1155.address))[6].minted).to.equal(2)
  expect((await membershipFactory.tiers(membershipERC1155.address))[5].minted).to.equal(0)
});
```

## Impact

At a certain stage, one or more of the DAO tiers will have more members than specified in the configuration (TierConfig.amount). Also, thee maximum allowed number of members (DAOInputConfig.maxMembers) will be exceeded.


## Tools Used

Manual Review


## Recommendations

In the upgradeTier function, decrease the value of TierConfig.minted for the lower tier and increase the value of TierConfig.minted for the higher tier. Also, verify that TierConfig.minted does not exceed TierConfig.amount for the higher tier.

# H01 - LSTRewardsSplitter::addFee - by accident, the same fee receiver could be added several times to the same RewardsSplitter

## Summary

**Link:** https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-09-stakelink/blob/contracts/core/lstRewardsSplitter/LSTRewardsSplitter.sol#L141

There is no control...


## Vulnerability Details

Some details...

**Proof of Concept:**

Add the following test to lst-rewards-splitter.test.ts:

```
it.only('the same feeReceiver can be added several times to to a RewardsSplitter', async () => {
 
  assert.equal(fromEther(await token.balanceOf(accounts[6])), 40)
})
```

## Impact

This would cause an indirect loss of funds...


## Tools Used

Manual Review


## Recommendations

Modify the _withdraw function

```diff
function _withdraw(address _operator, uint256 _amount) private {
    uint256 sharesAmount = lst.getSharesByStake(_amount);
    shareBalances[_operator] -= sharesAmount;
    totalShares -= sharesAmount;
    
+   lst.transfer(_operator, _amount);

    emit Withdraw(_operator, _amount, sharesAmount);
}
```
