## About the Project

One World Project is a dynamic DAO marketplace where users can actively participate in decentralized organizations. This repository contains smart contracts for creating and managing DAO memberships using ERC1155 tokens. The contracts facilitate the creation and management of DAO memberships. Each DAO membership is represented by an ERC1155 token with different tiers.
